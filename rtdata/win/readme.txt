INSTALLER SCRIPTS
-----------------

This "win" directory includes installer setup mechanisms for Windows 32/64.

As requested in issue 1904 ( http://code.google.com/p/rawtherapee/issues/detail?id=1904 ),
the preferred choice of setup mechanism is Wix widgets. However an InnoSetup script has been
created before the definitive choice and has been added to the source tree, for convenience.

Once the Wix setup mechanism will be operational, the InnoSetup can be supressed from the source
tree.

All discussion about the present document and the setup scripts has to be done in issue 1904.
