This is the directory where all translations should go.

Translations are loaded for a given term at three levels:

1) default
2) <Language>
3) <Language> <Locale/Variant>

Developers who are adding a new feature should add new strings *only* to default.  This file
should be comprised of basic English text.  It will be used in the event that there are no
more specific languages specified.

Translators should in general implement the <Language> file.  This is the generic translation
for a given language; for instance, 'French', 'German', 'Norsk', etc.  If a string exists in
this file (and the user has specified this language), then RawTherapee will override the value
in default with the value in <Language>.  Please note that the filename for this file must not
contain any spaces.

In some situations, translations may differ based on region, locale, etc.  A good example of this
is the difference in spelling between 'color' (American English) and 'colour' (British English).
In this case, the vast majority of strings are identical between English and English (UK); 
however, to keep the proper spelling in Britain, we have a locale file called 'English (UK)' which
contains the differences between the two.  RawTherapee uses locale files when:
 a) The user has selected a language which has a space in the file name
 b) There is another file which is identical to the locale file up until the space (i.e., 'English'
to the locale file 'English (UK)').

If a locale file is used, it is applied in the same manner as <Language> is to default.  The locale
will override any keys present from the ones in the language file (and in turn, the default).


It is recommended to look for differences from default using a text editor with compare cabailities.
For ease of maintentance, you should insert new entries in alphabetical order.  Comments *may*
be included, but in general you should try to avoid them as they can confuse comparison editors.
