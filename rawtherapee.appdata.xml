  <summary>A powerful cross-platform raw image processing program</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      RawTherapee is a powerful raw image processing program. All the internal calculations are done in a high precision 32-bit floating point engine which facilitates non-destructive editing. Images are opened directly without the hassle of having to import them. Adjustments made by the user are immediately reflected in the preview and saved to a separate sidecar file. These adjustments are then applied during the export process, or can be copied (fully and partially) onto other images, thereby allowing easy batch image processing.

    <p>
      All aspects of RawTherapee are documented in the RawPedia wiki. There is also an active forum and IRC channel for interaction with the developers and other users.
