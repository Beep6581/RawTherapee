The EdgePreservingDecomposition files contain standard C++ (standard except the first line) code for creating and, to a
limited extent (create your own uses!), messing with multi scale edge preserving decompositions of a 32 bit single channel
image. As a byproduct it contains a lot of linear algebra which can be useful for optimization problems that
you want to solve in rectangles on rectangular grids.

Anyway. Basically, this is an implementation of what's presented in the following papers:
	Edge-Preserving Decompositions for Multi-Scale Tone and Detail Manipulation
	An Iterative Solution Method for Linear Systems of Which the Coefficient Matrix is a Symetric M-Matrix
	Color correction for tone mapping
	Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

First one is most of what matters, next two are details, last everything else. I did a few things differently, especially:
	Reformulated the minimization with finite elements instead of finite differences. This results in better conditioning,
	slightly better accuracy (less artifacts), the possibility of a better picked edge stopping function, but more memory consumption.

	A single rotationally invariant edge stopping function is used instead of two non-invariant ones.

	Incomplete Cholseky factorization instead of Szeliski's LAHBF. Slower, but not subject to any patents.

	For tone mapping, original images are decomposed instead of their logarithms, and just one decomposition is made;
	I find that this way works plenty good (theirs isn't better or worse... just different) and is simpler.

Written by ben_pcc in Portland, Oregon, USA. Some history:
	Late April 2010, I develop interest in this stuff because photos of my ceramics lack local contrast.
	Mid 2010, it works but is too slow to be useful.
	Fall 2010, various unsuccessful attempts at speeding up are tried.
	Early December 2010, I get off the path of least resistance and write a matrix storage class with incomplete Cholesky decomposition.
	31 December 2010, the FEM reformulation works very well.
	1 January 2011, I'm cleaning up this file and readying it for initial release.
	12 - 14 November 2011, further cleanup, improvements, bug fixes, integration into Raw Therapee.

It's likely that I'll take apart and rerelease contents of this file (in the distant future) as most of it isn't edge preserving decomposition
and rather supporting material. SparseConjugateGradient alone is a workhorse I and a few others have been exploiting for a few years.
