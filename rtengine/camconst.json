/*

   DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!

   All changes made here will be lost on software update.
   If you want to add custom values or changes existing ones,
   create a "camconst.json" file next to your personal "options" file.
   Its values will then override and/or complete the ones of this file.

   If you add values for your own camera and are okay to share them with
   RawTherapee's community, please drop a link on the user's forum

   IMPORTANT:
   ----------
   
   1. If you set the dcraw matrix in your user file for an already existing entry
      in RT's file (same camera, same model), your values will replace RT's ones.
   2. If you set the Black level(s) values in your user file for an already existing
      entry in RT's file, your values will replace RT's ones, even if RT's ones are
      more complete and/or detailed. You might want to copy/paste RT's levels first
      (if provided) to your user's file and complete/modify it.

      Same for the White level(s), independently from the Black level(s).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This file is in JSON format and contains camera constants which RawTherapee uses
when parsing raw files.

Raw files themselves unfortunately do not contain all information needed for making
a raw conversion, typically color response information and black/white levels are
missing. That's why this file is needed.

It's read once during startup, so if the file is updated you need to restart
RawTherapee in order to take effect. The file is not intended for modification by
the casual user, but advanced users can add missing camera information to this file.
If you do so please report at http://code.google.com/p/rawtherapee/issues so we can
extend the distributed version of this file so your provided camera information
becomes available to all.

RawTherapee uses DCRAW as the raw format parser. DCRAW contains hard-coded camera
constants, but not for all cameras and not always accurate information. For example
DCRAW only support one white level, while some cameras have different white levels
per channel and per ISO. If a camera is not listed in this file the constants from
DCRAW will be used, if listed here this information will override any constants in
DCRAW (if any).

Some cameras may only have partial information here, for example if the raw file
itself contains a color matrix it's not entered here. A camera whose black level
is measured on special pixels in the raw file should only have white levels here
etc.

Examples:

    {
        // make and model separated with single space, must match make
        // and model as provided by dcraw (case-insensitive).
        "make_model": "ManufacturerA ModelB",
        // ColorMatrix with D65 Calibration Illuminant, in dcraw format
        "dcraw_matrix": [ 7530, -1942, -255, -4318, 11390, 3362, -926, 1694, 7649 ],
        // black and white level same for all colors at all ISOs
        "ranges": { "black": 10, "white": 1000 }
    },

        "dcraw_matrix": [ 7530,-1942,-255,-4318,11390,3362,-926,1694,7649 ],
        // black and white levels per ISO per channel
        // this example only two ISOs, normally the list should be more populated.
        // When RawTherapee asks for black/white levels for a specific ISO the closest
        // match is picked.
        "ranges": {
            "black": [
                { "iso": 100,  "levels": 10 }, // here only one level, same level for all channels
                { "iso": 3200, "levels": [ 50, 60, 50 ] } // 3 levels, G2 same as G1
            ],

                { "iso": 100,  "levels": [ 10000, 11000, 10000, 12000 ] }, // 4 levels, G1 and G2 different
                { "iso": 3200, "levels": [ 11000, 11000, 10000, 12000 ] }
