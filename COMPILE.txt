If you have problems with the compilation, identified the reason and fixed 
the bug, please send me the updated build scripts (CMakeLists.txt files) to:
hgabor@rawtherapee.com

Windows
-------

	METHOD 1:
		Requirements:
		- MinGW + MSYS
		- CMake
		- GTK and GTKMM development environments
		
		Compile:
		- Start MSYS
		- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree
		- Type: cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" .
		- Type: make install
		- You find the compiled program in the release directory

	METHOD 2:
		Requirements:
		- tdm-gcc 	(http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm-gcc-4.5.1.exe/download)
		- cmake 	(http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
		- mercurial (http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WindowsInstall)
		- gtkmm		(http://ftp.se.debian.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtkmm/2.22/)
		
		Compile:
		- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree
		- Type: cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release -DBINDIR=. -DDATADIR=. -DLIBDIR=.
		- Type: mingw32-make.exe install
		- You find the compiled program in the "release" directory

Linux
-----

	Requirements:
		- CMake
		- GTK and GTKMM development packages
		- libtiff, libpng, libjpeg, lcms, libiptcdata development packages
		- ...did I forget something?

	On Ubuntu/Debian the requirements can be installed by running:
		sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtk2.0-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libtiff-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev liblcms-dev libiptcdata-dev mercurial

	Compile:
		- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree
		- Type: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release -DBINDIR=. -DDATADIR=. -DLIBDIR=.
		- Type: make install
		- You find the compiled program in the release directory (you can copy it 
		anywhere you want)

	(By changing the cmake flags, you can change where the release is.  By removing all flags it should go to the standard system install location).


	Using Eclipse under Linux:
	
		Eclipse mercurial plugin:
			click Help -> Install new Software.
			The Eclipse Update Site for MercurialEclipse is available at this URL:
			http://cbes.javaforge.com/update
					
		Import the rawtherapee mercurial repository:
			File->new->'other'->mercurial->Clone existing repository
			fill in URL: https://rawtherapee.googlecode.com/hg
			
		Enter root directory of RawTherapee source tree from a terminal window.
		configure the source for Eclipse with:
			cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release -DBINDIR=. -DDATADIR=. -DLIBDIR=. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
				
		Eclipse does not do 'make install' but only 'make all' so to get the release there are 2 ways.
			1. type 'make install' in the console or,
			2. in 'Project'->'properties'->'C/C++ Make Project'->'Build (incremental build)' change 'all' to 'install'

OSX
---

Requirements:
- XCode Development Tools (you only need a subset of these, but it is probably easier to just install all of them)
- MacPorts
  - Set /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf to include "+no_x11 +quartz"
  - If you want to build for multiple architectures, add +universal to variants.conf.  Note that this will increase the size of the final application substantially.
    - Set /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf key 'universal_archs' to the architectures you wish to build for.  Possible values
      include "i386 x86_64 ppc ppc64"
    - Edit beginning of CMakeLists.txt to enable the same architectures as you added to variants.conf
  - Run "sudo port install cairomm pango-devel gtk2 cmake glibmm gtkmm lcms libiptcdata" to install all needed libraries and tools
  - If you don't already have Mercurial installed, run "sudo port install mercurial"
  - If you want to try OpenMP builds, run "sudo port install gcc45"

Compile:
- Enter root directory of RawTherapee source tree
- Type: cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-mp-4.5 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-mp-4.5 . (to enable OpenMP, assuming you have installed gcc45) OR:
        cmake -D OPTION_OMP=false . (to disable OpenMP and use the default compiler)
- Type: make install
- Type: ./tools/osx/make-app-bundle
- You will find a RawTherapee.dmg file in release/ folder; this is the distribution release and can be run on any machine which meets the 
  architecture requirements you specified in variants.conf earlier.

For any bugs or patches to the OSX build, please contact Wyatt <wyatt@digitalcave.ca>
