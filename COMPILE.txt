If you have problems with the compilation, please ask on the appropriated RawTherapee forum :
http://www.rawtherapee.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10

Preamble:
---------

Cmake is actually used to create the Makefiles (scripts that handle the build process) or specific Integrated Developement Environement (IDE) projects.
It is designed to find all necessary compilation flags for your specific machine, but everything can be overriden.

RT's build mechanism will generate a build information file, named "AboutThisBuild.txt", and require some parameters that can't be set by Cmake, so it's
done in our build script, and may be overriden at your own will. The build process also enable some sort of cross compiling, since you can only choose
a specific processor variation of the same type (e.g. core2, athlon64, which are both an x86 architecture). Real cross compiling (e.g. building the windows
version on a linux platform) has not been tested.

By default, no processor is specified, so Cmake/GCC will build RT for your processor (or maybe a generic processor). Developers that are providing build to
download then have to set the processor label manually (set to 'undefined' by default) with the PROC_FORCED_LABEL cmake's parameter (we assume that you know
how to specify a cmake parameter).

Note for developers that handle an automated build system : Mercurial is requested in order to produce the build information file, but you build system will
certainly only use the source code without any access to a Mercurial repository. In this case, you have to first build RT like explained below to generates
the build information files, then you can tell your build system to run cmake with the following additionnal parameter : -D AUTOMATED_BUILD_SYSTEM:BOOL=ON.
Cmake will then pass the files creation step, but will check the presence of the requested files and stop if they're not there.

	The toolchain:

		There is 2 method to compile RawTherapee, and they each rely on different and common packages. They are
		now referred to METHOD 1 and METHOD 2.
		Of course, you'll have to install the package for the build method explained later in this document.

		The rest of this document assumes that you've installed MinGW, MSYS and Gtkmm respectively to "C:\mingw",
		"C:\msys" and "C:\gtkmm". 
		This tutorial assume that you've installed the packages in paths THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN SPACES.

		METHOD 1:
			- MinGW-TDM (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm-gcc-4.5.1.exe/download)
			            OpenMP seems to be broken in TDM-GCC4.5.1, so when MinGW has been installed, download and install
			            libgomp form tdm-gcc-4.5.0
			            (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%204.5%20series/Previous/4.5.0-tdm-1%20SJLJ/gcc-4.5.0-tdm-1-openmp.zip/download)
			- MSYS      (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11.exe)
			            If you have some trouble installing MSYS, see here : http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS
			- CMake     (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
			            Version 2.8.4 or above si required for this platform
			- Gtkmm2.22 (http://ftp.se.debian.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtkmm/2.22/)

		METHOD 2:
			- MinGW-TDM (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm-gcc-4.5.1.exe/download)
			- CMake     (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
			- Gtkmm2.22 (http://ftp.se.debian.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtkmm/2.22/)

		Additionnal steps:
			When all the packages of your preferred method are installed:
			- set the GTKMM_BASEPATH user or system environment variable to the installation directory of Gtkmm
			  (the Gtkmm's installer can do it for you)
			- set the MINGW_BASEPATH user or system environment variable to the installation directory of MinGW32
			- set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH user or system environment variable to the location of the pkgconfig directories:
			      c:\mingw\lib\pkgconfig;c:\gtkmm\lib\pkgconfig
			  You have to restart the console to take this new variables into account
			- Copy the "Win32CMakeOptions-sample.txt" file located in the root directory of RT's source tree, to "cmo.txt" (e.g.)
			  You can edit that copy to change the compilation flags to your needs, but the default values should be fine.
			  However, if you wants to upload a build, you should set some additionnal information about your processor. There are two possibilities:
			  1. You pickup a target processor from "ProcessorTargets.cmake": all you have to do is set the PROC_TARGET_NUMBER parameter in cmo.txt
			     to the right target number.
			     If you choose the 'native' solution, you have to set the processor label manually in cmo.txt, by uncommenting and set the PROC_FORCED_LABEL
			     parameter. Please provide a short name, like "core i5" or "athlon64" (without double quote)... processor frequency if of no use.
			  2. You don't need specific processor flags, so you'll let PROC_TARGET_NUMBER set to 0, but you have to set the PROC_FORCED_LABEL parameter
			     in cmo.txt (don't forget to uncomment the line). Please provide a short name, like "core i5" or "athlon64" (without double quote)... processor
			     frequency if of no use.


	Building RT:

		METHOD 1:
			Requirements:
			- MinGW + MSYS
			- CMake
			- GTK and GTKMM development environments

			Compile:
			- Start an MSYS command line interface
			- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree (type: cd "/C/Absolute/Path/To/RawTherapee_sourceTree")
			- Type: cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Ccmo.txt .
			- Type: make install
			- You'll find the compiled program in the subdirectory named like the value of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE ("Release" in this example)

		METHOD 2:
			Requirements:
			- MinGW-TDM (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/TDM-GCC%20Installer/tdm-gcc-4.5.1.exe/download)
			- CMake     (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
			- Mercurial (http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/WindowsInstall)
			- Gtkmm     (http://ftp.se.debian.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtkmm/2.22/)

			Compile:
			- Start a standard DOS command line interface (WIN + "R" -> "cmd")
			- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree (type: cd C:\Absolute\Path\To\RawTherapee_sourceTree)
		  If you wants to upload a build, you should set some additionnal information about your processor. There are two possibilities:
		  1. You pickup a target processor from "ProcessorTargets.cmake": all you have to do is adding "-D PROC_TARGET_NUMBER:STRING=number"
		     to cmake's command line
		     If you choose the 'native' solution's number, you have to set the processor label manually by setting "-D PROC_FORCED_LABEL:STRING=procLabel"
		     in cmake's command line
		     Please provide a short name, like "core i5" or "athlon64" (without double quote)... processor frequency if of no use.
		  2. You don't need specific processor flags, you still have to set the PROC_FORCED_LABEL parameter (see point 1 righ above)
			- Type: mingw32-make.exe install
			- You'll find the compiled program in the subdirectory named like the value of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE ("Release" in this example)

Linux
-----

	Requirements:
		- CMake
		- GTK and GTKMM development packages
		- libtiff, libpng, libjpeg, lcms, libiptcdata development packages
		- ...did I forget something?

	On Ubuntu/Debian the requirements can be installed by running:
		sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtk2.0-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libtiff-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev liblcms-dev libiptcdata-dev mercurial

	Compile:
		- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree
		- Type: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release -DBINDIR=. -DDATADIR=. -DLIBDIR=.
		        developers that wants to provide a build has to set the PROC_FORCED_LABEL to their processor name, e.g.:
		        cmake -DPROC_FORCED_LABEL:STRING=athlon64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release -DBINDIR=. -DDATADIR=. -DLIBDIR=.
		- Type: make install
		- You find the compiled program in the release directory (you can copy it anywhere you want)

	(By changing the cmake flags, you can change where the release is.  By removing all flags it should go to the standard system install location).


	Using Eclipse under Linux:

		Eclipse mercurial plugin:
			click Help -> Install new Software.
			The Eclipse Update Site for MercurialEclipse is available at this URL:
			http://cbes.javaforge.com/update

		Import the rawtherapee mercurial repository:
			File->new->'other'->mercurial->Clone existing repository
			fill in URL: https://rawtherapee.googlecode.com/hg

		Enter root directory of RawTherapee source tree from a terminal window.
		configure the source for Eclipse with:
			cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release -DBINDIR=. -DDATADIR=. -DLIBDIR=. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
		If you wants to upload a build, you should set some additionnal information about your processor. There are two possibilities:
		1. You pickup a target processor from "ProcessorTargets.cmake": all you have to do is adding "-D PROC_TARGET_NUMBER:STRING=number"
		   to cmake's command line
		   If you choose the 'native' solution's number, you have to set the processor label manually by setting "-D PROC_FORCED_LABEL:STRING=procLabel"
		   in cmake's command line
		   Please provide a short name, like "core i5" or "athlon64" (without double quote)... processor frequency if of no use.
		2. You don't need specific processor flags, you still have to set the PROC_FORCED_LABEL parameter (see point 1 righ above)

		Eclipse does not do 'make install' but only 'make all' so to get the release there are 2 ways.
			1. type 'make install' in the console or,
			2. in 'Project'->'properties'->'C/C++ Make Project'->'Build (incremental build)' change 'all' to 'install'

OSX
---

Requirements:
- XCode Development Tools (you only need a subset of these, but it is probably easier to just install all of them)
- MacPorts
	- Set /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf to include "+no_x11 +quartz"
	- If you want to build for multiple architectures, add +universal to variants.conf.  Note that this will increase the size of the final application substantially.
		- Set /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf key 'universal_archs' to the architectures you wish to build for.  Possible values
		  include "i386 x86_64 ppc ppc64"
		- Edit beginning of CMakeLists.txt to enable the same architectures as you added to variants.conf
	- Run "sudo port install cairomm pango-devel gtk2 cmake glibmm gtkmm lcms libiptcdata" to install all needed libraries and tools
	- If you don't already have Mercurial installed, run "sudo port install mercurial"
	- If you want to try OpenMP builds, run "sudo port install gcc45"

Compile:
- Enter root directory of RawTherapee source tree
- Type: cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-mp-4.5 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-mp-4.5 . (to enable OpenMP, assuming you have installed gcc45) OR:
        cmake -D OPTION_OMP=false . (to disable OpenMP and use the default compiler)
  If you wants to upload a build, you should set some additionnal information about your processor. There are two possibilities:
  1. You pickup a target processor from "ProcessorTargets.cmake": all you have to do is adding "-D PROC_TARGET_NUMBER:STRING=number"
     to cmake's command line
     If you choose the 'native' solution's number, you have to set the processor label manually by setting "-D PROC_FORCED_LABEL:STRING=procLabel"
     in cmake's command line
     Please provide a short name, like "core i5" or "athlon64" (without double quote)... processor frequency if of no use.
  2. You don't need specific processor flags, you still have to set the PROC_FORCED_LABEL parameter (see point 1 righ above)
- Type: make install
- Type: ./tools/osx/make-app-bundle
- You will find a RawTherapee.dmg file in release/ folder; this is the distribution release and can be run on any machine which meets the 
  architecture requirements you specified in variants.conf earlier.

For any bugs or patches to the OSX build, please contact Wyatt <wyatt@digitalcave.ca>
