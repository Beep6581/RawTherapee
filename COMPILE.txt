Linux
-----

Requirements:
- CMake
- GTK and GTKMM development packages
- libtiff, libpng, libjpeg, lcms, libiptcdata development packages
- ...did I forget something?

On Ubuntu/Debian the requirements can be installed by running:
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtk2.0-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libtiff-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev liblcms-dev libiptcdata-dev subversion

Compile:
- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree
- Type: cmake .
- Type: make install
- You find the compiled program in the release directory (you can copy it 
anywhere you want)

...If you have problems with the compilation, identified the reason and fixed 
the bug, please send me the updated build scripts (CMakeLists.txt files) to:
hgabor@rawtherapee.com

OSX
---

Requirements:
- MacPorts
  - Set /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf to include "+universal +no_x11 +quartz"  (NOTE: as of this writing the Pango and Pango-devel ports are broken and will not build as Universal variants.  Until this is fixed, leave the universal flag off.)
  - Set /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf key 'universal_archs' to "i386 x86_64"
  - Run "sudo port install cairomm pango-devel gtk2 cmake glibmm gtkmm lcms libiptcdata" to install all needed libraries
- XCode Development Tools (you only need a subset of these, but it is probably easier to just install all of them)

Compile:
- Enter root directory of RawTherapee source tree
- Type: cmake .
- Type: make install
- Type: ./tools/osx/make-app-bundle
- You will find a RawTherapee.dmg file in release/ folder; this is the distribution release and can be run on any 10.5 or 10.6 Intel machine.
