
Windows
-------

Requirements:
- MinGW + MSYS
- CMake
- GTK and GTKMM development environments

Compile:
- Start MSYS
- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree
- Type: cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" .
- Type: make install
- You find the compiled program in the release directory

Linux
-----

Requirements:
- CMake
- GTK and GTKMM development packages
- libtiff, libpng, libjpeg, lcms, libiptcdata development packages
- ...did I forget something?

On Ubuntu/Debian the requirements can be installed by running:
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtk2.0-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libtiff-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev liblcms-dev libiptcdata-dev merciurial

Compile:
- Enter the root directory of the RawTherapee source tree
- Type: cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release -DBINDIR=. -DDATADIR=. -DLIBDIR=.
- Type: make install
- You find the compiled program in the release directory (you can copy it 
anywhere you want)

(By changing the cmake flags, you can change where the release is.  By removing all flags it should go to the standard system install location).

...If you have problems with the compilation, identified the reason and fixed 
the bug, please send me the updated build scripts (CMakeLists.txt files) to:
hgabor@rawtherapee.com

OSX
---

Requirements:
- XCode Development Tools (you only need a subset of these, but it is probably easier to just install all of them)
- MacPorts
  - Set /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf to include "+no_x11 +quartz"
  - If you want to build for multiple architectures, add +universal to variants.conf
    - Set /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf key 'universal_archs' to the architectures you wish to build for.  Possible values
      include "i386 x86_64 ppc ppc64"
    - Edit beginning of CMakeLists.txt to enable the same architectures as you added to variants.conf
  - Run "sudo port install cairomm pango-devel gtk2 cmake glibmm gtkmm lcms libiptcdata" to install all needed libraries and tools
  - If you don't already have Mercurial installed, run "sudo port install mercurial"
  - If you want to try OpenMP builds, run "sudo port install gcc45"

Compile:
- Enter root directory of RawTherapee source tree
- Type: cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-mp-4.5 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-mp-4.5 . (to enable OpenMP, assuming you have installed gcc45) OR:
        cmake -D OPTION_OMP=false . (to disable OpenMP and use the default compiler)
- Type: make install
- Type: ./tools/osx/make-app-bundle
- You will find a RawTherapee.dmg file in release/ folder; this is the distribution release and can be run on any machine which meets the 
  architecture requirements you specified in variants.conf earlier.
