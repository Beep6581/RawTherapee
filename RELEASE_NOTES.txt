
RAWTHERAPEE 4.0.7 RELEASE NOTES
-------------------------------

CAVEATS
-------
- Memory requirements
Please read http://rawtherapee.com/blog/maximizing-memory-efficiency

- Differences between the preview and the output image
The color-managed preview in RawTherapee is (and has always been) based on image data in the Working Space profile. Although the actual preview is rendered using a monitor profile (or sRGB profile, if the monitor profile is not specified), it does not reflect the Output Profile & Output Gamma settings. This can lead to a slightly different output rendering when Working Space profile and Output Space profiles are not the same. A workaround is to set them to the same values to ensure the preview accurately reflects the final rendered output. 

For generic use in an sRGB workflow when the output target is web-based image display, it is recommended to use the default values of the Color/ICM toolset (Working Profile = sRGB, Output Profile = RT_sRGB). 

Future releases of RawTherapee are planned to support a more comprehensive color-managed preview that will allow proofing with accurate visualization of the final output render based not only on the working space and monitor profiles, but also on the user-selected Output Profile and Output Gamma.

- Auto Levels behavior has changed
The new algorithm drives the following parameters: 
  Exposure compensation, 
  Highlight recovery amount & threshold, 
  Black level & shadow compression,
  RGB brightness,
  RGB contrast.
The profiles supplied with RawTherapee were changed to be compatible with the new auto levels logic, as in older profiles RGB contrast and brightness were preset to a fixed value. Old Tuned-# profiles have been removed.

- The new Exposure Compensation in thumbnail captions and file browser filter requires clearing of Rawtherapee's thumbnail cache (see Preferences > File Browser). If the thumbnail cache is not cleared, exposure compensation values will not be displayed in captions or recognized in filtering *for previously browsed images* only.

description: - language file changes,
             - profile changes,
             - tagged 4.0.6
             - line endings normalized to CR+LF in language files and 
             postprocessing profiles
             - fixed capitalization of "raw"
             - patched generateTranslationDiffs.sh to properly sort 
             numbered entries, e.g. 113 should be after 11 and 12, not 
             between. Small change - now comments appear before the 
             "!!!!!" section. Not worth worrying about imho. Also used 
             sort's -unique capabilities to not unnecessarily spawn 
             another process.
