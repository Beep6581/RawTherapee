RAWTHERAPEE 5.5-dev RELEASE NOTES

This is a development version of RawTherapee. We update the code almost daily. Every few months, once enough changes have accumulated and the code is stabilized, we make a new official release. Every code change between these releases is known as a "development" version, and this is one of them.

Start by reading the "Getting Started" article on RawPedia:
http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/

While we only commit tested and relatively stable code and so the development versions should be fairly stable, you should be aware that:
- Development versions only had limited testing, so there may be bugs unknown to us.
- You should report these bugs so that they get fixed for the next stable release. See
  www.rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/How_to_write_useful_bug_reports
- The way new tools work in the development versions is likely to change as we tweak and tune them, so your processing profiles may produce different results when used in a future stable version.
- Bugs present in the stable versions get fixed in the development versions, and make it into the next stable version when we make a new official release. That means that in some ways the development versions can be "more stable" than the latest stable release. At the same time, new features may introduce new bugs. This is a trade-off you should be aware of.


NEWS RELEVANT TO PHOTOGRAPHERS

RawTherapee supports most raw formats, including Pentax and Sony Pixel Shift, Canon Dual-Pixel, and those from Foveon and X-Trans sensors.
If you're wondering whether it supports your camera's raw format, first download RawTherapee and try for yourself. If a raw format is not supported it will either not open, or the preview in the Editor tab will appear black, white, or have a strong color cast - usually magenta. In that case, read the "Adding Support for New Raw Formats" RawPedia article.

In order to use RawTherapee efficiently you should know that:
- You can scroll all panels using the mouse scroll-wheel.
- You can right-click on a tool's name to automatically expand it while collapsing all others.
- To change slider values or drop-down list items with the mouse scroll-wheel, hold the Shift key. This is so that you can safely scroll the panels without accidentally changing a slider or other tool setting.
- All curves support the Shift and Ctrl keys while dragging a point. Shift+drag makes the point snap to a meaningful axis (top, bottom, diagonal, other), while Ctrl+drag makes your mouse movement super-fine for precise point positioning.
- There are many keyboard shortcuts which make working with RawTherapee much faster and give you greater control. Make sure you familiarize yourself with them on RawPedia's "Keyboard Shortcuts" page!

New features since 5.4:
- TODO.

RawTherapee and other open-source projects require access to sample raw files from various camera makes and models in order to support those raw formats correctly.
You can help by submitting raw files to RPU:
