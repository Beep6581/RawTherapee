CAVEATS
-------
- Memory requirements
Please read http://rawtherapee.com/blog/maximizing-memory-efficiency

- Differences between the preview and the output image
The color-managed preview in RawTherapee is (and has always been) based on image data in the Working Space profile. Although the actual preview is rendered using a monitor profile (or sRGB profile, if the monitor profile is not specified), it does not reflect the Output Profile & Output Gamma settings. This can lead to a slightly different output rendering when Working Space profile and Output Space profiles are not the same. A workaround is to set them to the same values to ensure the preview accurately reflects the final rendered output.
