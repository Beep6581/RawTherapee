RAWTHERAPEE DEVELOPMENT RELEASE NOTES
-------------------------------------

This is a development version of RawTherapee. We update the code every day, which means the smallest number in the version changes every day, and every few months when new features are finalized and known bugs are fixed we release a stable version. Every minor version in-between those stable versions is known as a "development" version, and this build is one of them.

While we only commit tested and relatively stable code and so the development versions should be fairly stable, you should be aware that:
- They only had limited testing, so there may be bugs unknown to us.
- You should report these bugs so they get fixed for the stable release. See www.rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/How_to_write_useful_bug_reports The way tools work in the development versions is likely to change as we tweak and tune them, so your processing profiles may produce different results when used in a future stable versions.
- Bugs present in the stable versions get fixed, and until a new stable version is released these fixes are present in these development versions, thereby making the development version "more stable" than the previous stable version. At the same time, new features may introduce new bugs :) This is a trade-off you should be aware of.

In order to use RawTherapee efficiently you should know that:
- You can scroll all panels using the mouse scroll-wheel.
- You can right-click on a tool's name to automatically expand it while collapsing all others.
- To change slider values or drop-down list items with the mouse scroll-wheel, hold the Shift key. This is so that you can safely scroll the panels without accidentally changing a slider or other tool setting.
- All curves support the Shift and Ctrl keys while dragging a point. Shift+drag makes the point snap to meaningful axes (top, bottom, diagonal, other), while Ctrl+drag makes your mouse movement super-fine for precise point positioning.
- There are many keyboard shortcuts which make working with RawTherapee much faster and give you greater control, make sure you familiarize yourself with them on RawPedia's Keyboard Shortcuts page!
