RAWTHERAPEE 4.0.12 RELEASE NOTES
--------------------------------
This version is to be considered a release candidate for 4.1-stable.
Everyone should read the "caveats" section.

CAVEATS
-------
- Ctrl+q / Ctrl+b
As of this version, Ctrl+q is used to (q)uit RawTherapee and Ctrl+b is used to send the currently open image in the Editor tab to the (b)atch Queue. In the past Ctrl+q was used to send the image to the Batch Queue, but Ctrl+q is a widely used shortcut to close the application, so we adopted that convention.

- For people compiling RawTherapee
Build-time requirements:
GCC-4.7 or newer is recommended as older versions in some cases can lead to artifacts.
When using GCC-4.8.* you must use -fno-aggressive-loop-optimizations (issue 2121).
GTK+ >=2.24.18 is recommended, as the FileChooserButton in older versions of GTK+ is buggy (issue 1852).

- Memory requirements
