CAVEATS
-------
- Memory requirements
Please read http://rawtherapee.com/blog/maximizing-memory-efficiency

- Differences between the preview and the output image
The color-managed preview in RawTherapee is (and has always been) based on image data in the Working Space profile. Although the actual preview is rendered using a monitor profile (or sRGB profile, if the monitor profile is not specified), it does not reflect the Output Profile & Output Gamma settings. This can lead to a slightly different output rendering when Working Space profile and Output Space profiles are not the same. A workaround is to set them to the same values to ensure the preview accurately reflects the final rendered output. 

For generic use in an sRGB workflow when the output target is web-based image display, it is recommended to use the default values of the Color/ICM toolset (Working Profile = sRGB, Output Profile = RT_sRGB). 

Future releases of RawTherapee are planned to support a more comprehensive color-managed preview that will allow proofing with accurate visualization of the final output render based not only on the working space and monitor profiles, but also on the user-selected Output Profile and Output Gamma.
