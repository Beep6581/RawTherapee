To use the RawTherapee Application:
    You must drag the app from the .dmg into the /Applications folder.

If you wish to use the Command-Line Interface:
    An unsigned -cli is in the zip along with the .dmg. 
    You must install the app from the .dmg into /Applications and copy the -cli to your /usr/local/bin. 
    The -cli will load its libraries dynamically from the app in /Applications.
