#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This Bash4 script checks whether each key in "default" is used in
# a .cc or .h file. Those that are not are printed to screen, and the
# user is asked if they should be deleted from all language files.
#
# Keys in commented-out sections are treated as if they weren't there.
# The following comment styles are handled:
#  // key
#  /* key
#  key */

# It does not handle dynamically built keys:
#   HISTORY_MSG_
#   EXTPROGTARGET_
#   FILEBROWSER_POPUPRANK
#   FILEBROWSER_POPUPCOLORLABEL
#
# The script can also clean up already-translated files by removing keys which
# do not exist in default.
#
# Run the script from the project root:
#   ./tools/generateUnusedKeys
#
# Doublecheck the deletion before committing.
# Run ./tools/generateTranslationDiffs before and after running this script.
#
# Blame DrSlony
# Please report bugs or enhancements to http://code.google.com/p/rawtherapee/issues/list
