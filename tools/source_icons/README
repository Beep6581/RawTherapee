The repository tools/source_icons contains source icons (in SVG format) and the script to generate PNG icons for both Dark and Light themes.

tools/source_icons/scalable
---------------------------
- Contains icons in SVG format.
- A sidecar *.file for each *.svg file.
- The sidecar *.file has the following format:
	-> Fields are separated by a comma.
	-> The first field defines the PNG filename to be created.
	-> The second field indicates either the width (e.g. w22) or the height (e.g. h16) in pixels for the PNG file.
	-> The third field is optional. It indicates the icon category (e.g. actions, devices, places). If not indicated, the icon is assumed to belong to "actions".

tools/source_icons/script
-------------------------
- The main script which creates the icons is make_all_icon_theme.bash
- Launch:
    ./make_all_icon_theme.bash /path/to/new/svg/icons/ /tmp/png
- An archive with all the icons will be created in /tmp/png

Guidelines for icon name
------------------------
- Use stock item names when prebuilt icons exist (e.g. gtk-open.png). See http://developer.gnome.org/gtk/2.24/gtk-Stock-Items.html
- Use "-" to separate words (e.g. panel-to-left.png)
- Avoid the use of the icon's size as a suffix in the filename (colour.png and not colour-24.png). If needed, use the suffix -large or -small (gtk-close-small.png).

How to easily work with new icons
---------------------------------
1- Have a dir which contains only the new SVG files
2- Creates a .file for each .svg (change "w22" and "actions" as needed, explained above):
     for f in *.svg; do printf "%s\n" "${f%%.*}.png,w22,actions" > "${f%%.*}.file"; done
3- Makes the PNG icons (you need to run the script from it's containing dir):
     cd ~/rawtherapee/tools/source_icons/script && ./make_all_icon_theme.bash /path/to/new/svg/icons/ /tmp/png
