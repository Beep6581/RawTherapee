The repository tools/source_icons contains source icons (in svg format) and the script to generate png icons for both Dark and Light themes.


===================================
=== tools/source_icons/scalable ===
===================================
- contains icons in svg format
- a sidecar *.file for each *.svg file
- the sidecar *.file has the following format:
	-> colum are separated with a comma
	-> first column list the *.png file to be created
	-> second column indicates either the width (e.g. w22) or the height (e.g. h16) in pixel for the *.png file
	-> third column is optional. It indicates the icon category (e.g. actions, devices, places). If not indicated, the icon is supposed to belong to "actions"


=================================
=== tools/source_icons/script ===
=================================
- the main script which creates the icons is make_all_icon_theme.bash
- launch make_all_icon_theme.bash tools/source_icons/scalable /tmp/png
- an archive with all the icons will be created in /tmp/png

================================
=== guidelines for icon name ===
================================
- Use stock item name when prebuilt icon exists (e.g. gtk-open.png). See http://developer.gnome.org/gtk/2.24/gtk-Stock-Items.html
- Use "-" to separate words (e.g. panel-to-left.png)
- Avoid the use of icon size as a suffix to name icon (colour.png and nor colour-24.png). If needed, use the suffix -large or -small (gtk-close-small.png).
