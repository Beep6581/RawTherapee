The repository tools/source_icons contains source icons (in svg format) and the script to generate png icons for both Dark and Light themes.


===================================
=== tools/source_icons/scalable ===
===================================
- contains icons in svg format
- a sidecar *.file for each *.svg file
- the sidecar *.file has the following format:
	-> colum are separated with a comma
	-> first column list the *.png file to be created
	-> second column indicates either the width (e.g. w22) or the height (e.g. h16) in pixel for the *.png file
	-> third column is optional. It indicates the icon category (e.g. actions, devices, places). If not indicated, the icon is supposed to belong to "actions"
