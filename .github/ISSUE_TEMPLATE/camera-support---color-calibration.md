<!-- If files from your camera cannot be opened by RawTherapee, or the colors are wrong, please provide information to improve support for your camera. Please read http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/Adding_Support_for_New_Raw_Formats and provide the necessary shots.
If you own a color calibration target (such as an X-Rite ColorChecker Passport), you can further improve the color rendition of files from your camera. Please read http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/How_to_create_DCP_color_profiles and provide the necessary shots.

Requests without providing the necessary information will be deleted. -->
