.SH NAME
rawtherapee \- an advanced cross-platform program for developing raw photos.

\fBrawtherapee\fP [\-o|\-O <output>] [\-s|\-S] [\-p <file>] [\-d]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRawTherapee\fP is an advanced program for developing raw photos and for 
processing non-raw photos. It is non-destructive, makes use of OpenMP, supports 
all the cameras supported by dcraw and carries out its calculations in a high 
precision 32bit floating point engine.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-o <output file>|<output dir>
select output directory.
.TP
\-O <output file>|<output dir>
 select output directory and copy the PP3 file into it.
.TP
\-s
use the PP3 processing profile located next to the input file (which shares 
same name as the input file) when building the processing parameters, e.g.: for 
IMG001.NEF there should be a IMG001.NEF.pp3 in the same directory. If such a 
file is not found, the default values are used.
.TP
\-S
like \-s but skip processing that image if its corresponding PP3 file is not 
found.
.TP
\-p <PP3 file>
specify a PP3 processing profile to be used for all conversions. You can 
specify as many \-p options as you like (see note below).
.TP
\-d
use the default raw or non-raw PP3 file to build the image's parameters 
(specified in the options file).
.TP
\-j[1\-100]
specify output to be JPEG (default). The compression value can be in the range 
1-100. If none was specified, the default compression value is 90, balanced
subsampling (4:2:2).
.TP
\-t
specify output to be uncompressed 8 bit per channel TIFF.
.TP
\-t1
specify output to be zip-compressed 8 bit per channel TIFF.
.TP
\-n
specify output to be 8 bit per channel PNG with a compression value of 6.
.TP
\-Y
overwrite output if present.

.P
.B Note:
.br
You can use partial PP3 files, in which case RawTherapee will set the
missing values as follows:
.br
  The PP3 file is first built with internal default values;
.br
  then overridden by those found in the "default raw" or "default non-raw" photo
profile (if \-d has been set);
.br
  then overridden by those found in the PP3 files provided by \-p, each one
overriding the previous values;
.br
  then overridden by the sidecar file if \-s is set and if the file exists;
.br
  the time when the sidecar file is used depends of the position of the \-s
switch in the command line relative to the \-p parameters
(e.g. "\-p first.pp3 \-p second.pp3 -s \-p fourth.pp3").
