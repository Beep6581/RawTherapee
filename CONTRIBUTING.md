## Contributing as a Programmer
- Announce and discuss your plans in GitHub before starting work.
- Keep branches small so that completed and working features can be merged into the "dev" branch often, and so that they can be abandoned if they head in the wrong direction.
- Use C++11
- Code must be run through astyle version 3 or newer before being merged.
