Difference between Preview and Output image:


   The color managed preview in RawTherapee is (and has always been) based 
   on image data in the Working Space profile. Although the actual preview 
   is rendered using a monitor profile (or sRGB profile, if monitor profile 
   is not specified), it does not reflect the Output profile & Output Gamma 
   settings. This can lead to a slightly different output rendering when 
   Working Space profile and Output Space profiles are not the same. 
   A workaround is to set them to the same values to ensure the preview 
   accurately reflects the final render output.
   
   For generic use in sRGB workflow when output is targeting web-based image 
   display, it is recommended to use the default values of the Color/ICM toolset.
   
   Future releases of RawTherapee are planned to support a more comprehensive 
   color-managed preview that will allow accurate visualization of the final 
   output render based on not only the working space and monitor profiles, 
   but also on user-selected Output color profile and Output Gamma.
